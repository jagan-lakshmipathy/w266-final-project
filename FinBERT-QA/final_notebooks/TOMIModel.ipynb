Starting a new online business\n","Recommendations for user 42: [b\"A practical issue is that insider trading transfers wealth from most investors to the few insiders. If this were permitted, non-insiders would rarely make any money, and they'd stop investing. That would then defeat the purpose of the capital markets which is to attract capital. A moral issue is that managers and operators of a company should act in shareholders' interests. Insider trading directly takes money from other shareholders and transfers it to the insider. It's a nasty conflict of interest (and would allow any CEO of a public company to make ton of money quickly, regardless of their job performance). In short, shareholders and management should succeed or suffer together, so their interests are as aligned as possible and managers have the proper incentives.\"\n"," b\"I'd worry more about falsifying documents of sale.  No good reason at all to do that. Detecting counterfeit bills is easy if they're all new bills.  Hold them up to the light and look for the watermark and the numbered tape in the bill.  Refuse any bad ones.\"\n"," b\"I'd not do business under these terms. A bill of sale needs a signature, right? Your signature is your word, and your word is your bond. I wouldn't participate in such a fraud, nor would I accept this sum of cash, who knows its origins?\"\n"," b\"Think carefully about the added expenses.  It may still make sense, but it probably won't be as cheap as you are thinking.  In addition to the mortgage and property taxes, there is also insurance and building maintenance and repairs. Appliances, carpets, and roofs need to be replaced periodically.  Depending on the area of the country there is lawn maintenance and now removal. You need to make sure you can cover the expenses if you are without a tenant for 6 months or longer.  When tenants change, there is usually some cleaning and painting that needs to be done. You can deduct the mortgage interest and property taxes on your part of the building.  You need to claim any rent as income, but can deduct the other part of the mortgage interest and taxes as an expense.  You can also deduct building maintenance and repairs on the rental portion of the building.  Some improvements need to be depreciated over time (5-27 years).  You also need to depreciate the cost of the rental portion of the building.  This basically means that you get a deduction each year, but lower the cost basis of the building so you owe more capital gains taxes when you sell. If you do this, I would get a professional to do your taxes at least the first year.  Its not hard once you see it done, but there are a lot of details and complications that you want to get right.\"\n"," b\"If you get counterfeit money, then you're dealing with the criminal who is going to be punished by the law for doing that. The portion of the total sum that was paid with the counterfeit currency is considered unpaid and you can claim the money from the criminal and sue him, while he's in jail. He'll work hard on those license plates to pay you off. However, making false statements and assisting in a tax evasion scheme compromises your ability to go to the law enforcement in case of any wrongdoing, and then you should worry about the counterfeit money, because the law won't be on your side to help you. And you don't even get anything out of it... Why on earth are you willing to take this risk? Just so you know, it may also be money laundering, which may get you in trouble even more with the law.\"\n"," b\"First, you can look up the property tax of the building you are in for an exact number. Go to you town's tax office or look at Zillow. You need to claim the rent as income, but will take all expenses as well as depreciation on half the building. The numbers may well work in your favor, especially as a resident landlord. I still own a rental in the next state, but it's 2 hour away, so I'm paying pros to do the simplest things. On site, you can handle all maintenance and save that way.  If the cash flow looks like it's better than what you have right now, it might be time to buy. Without seeing the numbers I can't point out what you might be missing.\"\n"," b'The biggest question is do you want to be a landlord? There are a lot of ups and down to managing property from bad tenants to having to fix a water heater or replace a fridge.   If you aren\\'t interested in being a landlord, it is definitely a bad idea.   If you do want to be a landlord, then the question is how close do you want to be to your tenants?   What if they are up late making noise, etc.?   What if they watch TV all night and you hear it through the walls?   What is your plan?   You ask if people have trouble \"sharing\" a house.   If you are the landlord and the other party the tenant, then you aren\\'t \"Sharing\", you are leasing.   It\\'s a different relationship with different strains.'\n"," b\"Keep up on routine maintenance. That's the best way to prolong the life of your car, and it'll save you money in the long run because you won't have to replace your car as often. Accelerate gently. The harder you push the gas pedal, the more gas you use. Coast to a stop rather than using your brakes. If you can avoid stopping by slowing down well before a red light so that by the time you actually get to the light it is green again, do so. Avoid high-speed driving. At highway speeds, wind resistance plays a big part in how much gas your car uses. If you can plan your trips to take slower routes, do so. Don't be the guy driving 55 in the left lane on the highway, though. Avoid stop-and-go traffic. Keeping to a constant speed is the most efficient. Plan your trips to avoid areas with lots of traffic, lots of curb-cuts and intersections, etc. Leave lots of space in front of you so you have time to anticipate other drivers intentions and slow down rather than having to slam on your brakes at the last second. Avoid short trips. Cars work best when they can get all the way up to operating temperature, and stay there for a while. If you're just going two miles, ride your bike. Live close to work and a grocery store, so you can walk or ride your bike rather than driving. Use your car for road trips and your quarterly trips to CostCo to restock the larder. If you can get away with not owning a car, sell it. Ride your bike, use public transit, or walk. If you can share a car with a significant other and only one of you has a long car commute, there's no sense in you both owning a car.\"\n"," b'You are a \"strategic\" investor, which is to say that you are in the best position to evaluate the deal because you already live there. Others don\\'t have this advantage going in, which is why they might not be inclined to do what you\\'re doing. Your biggest advantage is that you know at least one tenant. In essence, you are your own \"tenant\" for the top floor You also presumably have a pretty good idea of the neighborhood. These are arguments for owning your own home, although it does get a bit trickier with a second tenant, whom you may not know. Do check credit and references, etc. You might ask the landlord why he wants to sell. Presumably it\\'s because he wants to retire or move, and not a problem with the property. But it does no harm to ask.'\n"," b'I\\'m surprised at the tone of the answers to this question! Trading with insider information is corruption and encourages fraud. As in many areas, there\\'s an ethical line where behavior the gap between \"ok\" and \"illegal\" or unethical is thin. The classic local government insider information example is when the local councilman finds out that a highway exit is being constructed in an area that consists mostly of farmland. Knowing this, he buys out the farmers at what they think is a premium, and turns around for 10x profit a few months later. In that context, do you think that the councilman acting on that insider information is committing a crime or ethical lapse? Most people say yes.  Even in this case, the line is thin. If the same councilman has his finger on the pulse of growth patterns in the area, and realizes that the terrain makes a certain area a prime candiate for a highway and exit, buying up land would not be criminal -- but it would be risky as it creates a perception that he is abusing his position.']\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["rr, ap, cg = run_twotower_scores(test_set, scann_index)\n","\n","print('Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR):', np.mean(rr))\n","print('Mean average Precision (MAP)', np.mean(ap))\n","print('Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)', np.mean(cg))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"HlF1QOHdBQU8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1659128808836,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":2290,"user":{"displayName":"jagannathan Lakshmipathy","userId":"05639691877293412421"}},"outputId":"bf0ce175-06b0-48e2-ca77-1d85ed1aaf13"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR): 0.568651985318652\n","Mean average Precision (MAP) 0.568651985318652\n","Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) 0.5150760419681824\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["embedding_dimension = 128\n","question_model, answer_model = get_two_towers(embedding_dimension)\n","model = QAModel(question_model, answer_model)\n","model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adagrad(learning_rate=0.1))\n","model.fit(cached_train, epochs=5)\n","\n","model.evaluate(cached_test, return_dict=True)\n","\n","scann_index = tfrs.layers.factorized_top_k.ScaNN(model.question_model)\n","scann_index.index_from_dataset(\n","  tf.data.Dataset.zip((answers.batch(100), answers.batch(100).map(model.answer_model)))\n",")\n","\n","rr, ap, cg = run_twotower_scores(test_set, scann_index)\n","\n","print('Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR):', np.mean(rr))\n","print('Mean average Precision (MAP)', np.mean(ap))\n","print('Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)', np.mean(cg))"],"metadata":{"id":"cRRYPmSpv72_","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1659128878038,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":68958,"user":{"displayName":"jagannathan Lakshmipathy","userId":"05639691877293412421"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"db2f7e46-0771-4cc2-dc06-991f30f74118"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Epoch 1/5\n","14/14 [==============================] -
