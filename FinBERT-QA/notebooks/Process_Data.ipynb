It simplifies documenting your income/expenses. You can \"explain\" every dollar entering and exiting the account without having to remember that some of them were for non-business items. My credit union allowed me to have a 2nd checking account and allowed me to put whatever I wanted as the name on the check. I think this looked a little better than having my name on the check. I don't see the need for a separate checking account for investing. The money can be kept in a separate savings account that has no fees, and can even earn a little interest. Unless you are doing a lot of investment transactions a month this has worked for me. I fund IRAs and 529 plans this way. We get paychecks 4-5 times a month, but send money to each of the funds once a month. You will need a business account if the number of transactions becomes large. If you deposit dozens of checks every time you go to the bank, the bank will want to move you to a business account.\n"]}],"source":["print(\"Example QA pair: \\n\")\n","print(\"Question: {}\".format(queries.at[3, 'question']))\n","\n","x = collection[collection['docid']==296717]\n","\n","print()\n","print(\"Answer: {}\".format(x.at[28732, 'doc']))"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"geR_D-06aAwe","outputId":"ccc58fd8-c04a-473b-8a1b-d1c7fc589e42","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1655753143917,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":124,"user":{"displayName":"jagannathan Lakshmipathy","userId":"05639691877293412421"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Number of answers: 57638\n","Number of questions: 6648\n","Number of QA pairs: 17110\n"]}],"source":["print(\"Number of answers: {}\".format(len(collection)))\n","print(\"Number of questions: {}\".format(len(queries)))\n","print(\"Number of QA pairs: {}\".format(len(qid_docid)))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"WtTT2H9YTPwV"},"source":["# **Clean data**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"lAVwwt-ZTL5y","outputId":"ad81b018-a4ef-4eb7-b9c9-4b8447065e81","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1655753149089,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":2916,"user":{"displayName":"jagannathan Lakshmipathy","userId":"05639691877293412421"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Number of answers after cleaning: 57600\n","Number of QA pairs after cleaning: 17072\n"]}],"source":["# Cleaning data\n","empty_docs, empty_id = get_empty_docs(collection)\n","# Remove empty answers from collection of answers\n","collection_cleaned = collection.drop(empty_id)\n","# Remove empty answers from qa pairs\n","qid_docid = qid_docid[~qid_docid['docid'].isin(empty_docs)]\n","\n","print(\"Number of answers after cleaning: {}\".format(len(collection_cleaned)))\n","print(\"Number of QA pairs after cleaning: {}\".format(len(qid_docid)))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"cLPWIz0wUnRj"},"source":["# **Prepare data for Anserini**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"6cRzxOucdnIO"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Write collection df to file\n","save_tsv(\"retriever/collection_cleaned.tsv\", collection_cleaned)\n","\n","# Convert collection df to JSON file for Anserini's document indexer\n","collection_to_json(\"retriever/collection_json/docs.json\", \"retriever/collection_cleaned.tsv\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"je6ozF8twmO-"},"source":["# **Process Data**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"PUPVix9Swvim"},"outputs":[],"source":["processed_answers = process_answers(collection_cleaned)\n","processed_questions = process_questions(queries)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":224},"id":"Jc0jF3AYyS50","outputId":"22a4c0bd-322c-45f0-eb93-2e4c81406e12","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1655753170771,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":135,"user":{"displayName":"jagannathan Lakshmipathy","userId":"05639691877293412421"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Processed and tokenized questions\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   qid                                           question  \\\n","0    0  What is considered a business expense on a bus...   \n","1    1  Claiming business expenses for a business with...   \n","2    2  Transferring money from One business checking ...   \n","3    3  Having a separate bank account for business/in...   \n","4    4  Business Expense -
